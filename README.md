# Double-Relative
Program for the rhythm game osu! that allows users to double, triple, or otherwise lengthen existing maps.

Double Relative is a simple console app that allows users to pick any .osu file and then lengthen it by any amount. 
It copies the existing objects and timing points and moves them to the end of the file as many times as the user chooses. The audio file is copied the same way.
